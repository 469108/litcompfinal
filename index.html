    When i was in grade school, i fondly remember being picked up from school, only to be taken to downtown Portland, Oregon as my mother had not yet claimed her status as a US citizen, i remember looking out onto the city as we exit the tunnel into open air, as we drive through the area, i see drawings spray painted onto the various infrastructure. As the car went down the road, I realised that it wasn't just one or two drawings, but many, many pieces of art displayed on the various walls and infrastructure. As I caught glimpse after glimpse of what are seemingly scribbles painted about on the walls, I began to question: what do these drawings mean? Who left these here? How old are these murals? Are these drawings even supposed to be here? What is the purpose of leaving these here in the first place? And how on earth do they reach some of the places that they do? As I made visits to Portland in the future, these questions only seemed to grow bigger, before I eventually started to accept these drawings, or “graffiti” as an inevitability. In the coming years, I started to become more and more fond of these graffiti, splayed across the walls of the various metropolises around the world, but why?

<p>Hello. My name is Adam Haggi. I am currently a student. Today, i will be talking about Graffiti<br> <br>
    I have always been interested in graffiti. Driving by cities and seeing the various graffiti sprayed on the wall has always been intriguing to me, even if I may not be able to make out words or sentences. <br> <br>
    Graffiti has always been a constant of cities. There is no city I've been to that doesnt have some kind of graffiti. Even the cleanest of cities have no shortage of graffiti. It has always been a staple of city living, and I doubt that will ever change as long as cities are bustling. <br> <br>
    Graffiti can be a double edged sword, as having the will to write on anything can inevitably end up as an obstruction. There are people who cover entire abandoned buildings in spray-paint, advertise themself, and write obscenities but alot of other graffiti are genuine pieces of art that can be seen as, in a way, a love letter to the community. Subway art, for example, is well known for colorful and otherwise symbolistic art drawn across an entire subway. <br> <br>
    I find this topic is very relevant, as I'm sure everybody knows well what graffiti is, but when was the last time you actually stopped and thinked about it? To most, graffiti is an inevitability and nothing more, but it can be seen as a lot more if performed correctly. I believe something great can come out of grafitti if the illustrator puts real dedication, care, and love into their work. <br> <br>
